# HyperLightDrifter-AutoDash-OSX
Auto-dash script for Hyper Light Drifter on OSX

### About
Chain dashing in Hyper Light Drifter is hard. Doing it 800 times in a row is nearly impossible. This script presses the spacebar for you automatically at the (nearly) correct intervals to get you a very long chain of dashes in the game. This was a quick hack and fails to get all the way to 800 occasionally, but it worked for me, so I thought I'd share.

### Requirements
[HammerSpoon](hammerspoon.org) for OSX

### Usage
Copy/paste this script into your config.lua in HammerSpoon to use this code. Make sure that you are using keyboard controls in the game, and that you've bound the spacebar to dash. 

Go to the track in the dash upgrade shop, and position the mouse cursor over one of the stamina recharge pads in the top or bottom center while standing within dash distance of it. Then push cmd+alt+ctrl+s to start the script. You should kind of dash back and forth over the pad with your mouse as the middle point between your dashes -- this means it's working, so just let it sit until you're happy with the result or it hits the limit of 850 dashes. If it fails, or you want to stop the script, push cmd+alt+ctrl+c.
